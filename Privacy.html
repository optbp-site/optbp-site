                            Information which you supply through our support portal, on which you should never include any
                            personal medical information, may be stored by the suppliers and advisers we engage to help us
                            run
                            and deliver our business, in servers or data centres located outside the EU. Naturally, we
                            expect
                            our suppliers to take information security as seriously as we do so we put appropriate measures
                            in
                            place requiring suppliers to treat the information to EU standards for the protection of your
                            personal information. Even so, any transfer of information to other countries in this way could
                            result in that information being available to the government and other authorities in those
                            countries under their laws.
