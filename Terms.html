                            <h2>Your privacy</h2>

                        <P>
                            Any data that we collect about you (including Health Data) through your use of the Service is subject to the Optimise BP privacy policy which, by agreeing to these Terms, you acknowledge that you have read and understood.

                            In order to use the Service, we require you to create an Account by providing us with your name, email address and a strong password. Users are responsible for all of the activity that occurs in association with their Account. A user must ensure all the information entered is correct, and free from errors.

                        <P>
                            In order for the Optimise BP service to function correctly, we require users to keep all non customisable notifications turned on at all times. Bypassing or turning off notifications means that Optimise BP cannot guarantee safe functioning of the software and Optimise BP is not liable for any loss or damage that is caused due to failure to keep notifications switched on.

                            <h2>Technical requirements</h2>

                            A GP Practice may not have signed up to all Optimise BP services and is able to activate and deactivate certain elements or all of the Optimise BP service. This may apply to some or all patients. This may impact on the ability to use the service and if this happens users should take this up directly with their Practice. Optimise BP has no control over how Practices decide to interact with the Optimise BP services.In the event that Optimise BP becomes unavailable, Patient Users should always have other means of connecting with your GP Practice.

                        <P>
                            In the event of these Terms being terminated for whatever reason:
                            <ol>
                                <li>your licence to use the Service shall immediately terminate;</li>

                                <li>within a reasonable period of time following termination (but no earlier than 30 days following termination) we shall use our reasonable endeavours to delete your Health Data from our servers.</li>
                            </ol>
                        <p>
                            Following deletion, we will be unable to return your Health Data to you, however for reasons of NHS data audit we will retain the details of the transactions you completed through your GP services for no shorter than 70 years.

                            <h2>Limit of Liability</h2>

                        <p>
                            We do not limit our liability under these Terms for:
                            <ol>
                                <li>death or personal injury caused by the relevant party’s negligence or that of our employees, agents or subcontractors;</li>
                                <li>fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation by us or our employees;</li>
                                <li>any other act, omission or liability which may not be limited under applicable law.</li>
                            </ol>
                        <p>
                            Subject to the previous paragraph, we shall not be liable for any amount, except to the extent that it reflects actual damage suffered and that damage is of a pecuniary nature.

                            <h2>General Terms</h2>

                        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time (the “Updated Terms“). If we do so, then the Updated Terms will be brought to your attention and if you continue to use the Service following such notification then the Updated Terms will be deemed to take immediate effect.

                        <p>Optimise Health Ltd’s performance of this agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in this agreement is in derogation of Optimise BP’s right to comply with law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Optimise BP Software or information provided to or gathered by Optimise Health Ltd with respect to such use.

                        <p>We may transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms to another organisation at any time. We may also sub-contract any of our obligations to any third party without your consent. You may only transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms to another person if we expressly agree to this in writing.

                        <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us and you and supersedes and extinguishes all previous agreements, promises, assurances, warranties and understandings between them, whether written or oral, relating to its subject matter. You agree that entering into these Terms you do not rely on, and shall have no remedies in respect of, any statement, representation, assurance or warranty (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not set out in these Terms.

                        <p>If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. A person who is not a party to these Terms shall not have any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any provision of these Terms

                        <p>Each of the conditions of these Terms operates separately. If any court or competent authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining conditions will remain in full force and effect.

                        <p>
                            These Terms, their subject and formation, are governed by English law. You and we both agree that the courts of England and Wales will have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms or their subject matter or formation (including, without limitation, non-contractual disputes or claims).
